Odin Project Landing Page Assignment 


This assignment involves making an example landing page, using all the knowledge I have gained from the HTML and CSS resources from the foundations course on the Odin Project. 

Within this directory I have included the example image of the landing page and the font reference provided by the assignment page.

For practice I will also be making regular GitHub commits.



Concluding Comments

This project was helpful in cementing some of the knowledge I gained from the course. I found flexbox to be extremely useful, albeit a little complicated in terms of centering and justifying content in the way that I intended. I found putting content into divs helped keep my work organised although I may have not used their classes and IDs as efficiently as I could have and will keep this in mind for future projects.
